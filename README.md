# Coursework skeleton

This is the skeleton for the coursework of the Principle of Distributed Ledgers 2023.
It contains [the interfaces](./src/interfaces) of the contracts to implement and an [ERC20 implementation](./src/contracts/PurchaseToken.sol).

The repository uses [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/working-on-an-existing-project).


## Things to note

I've added a lot of tests, you can find them in the test folder. I've tried to follow standard naming conventions. 

Hopefully the code is readable!
